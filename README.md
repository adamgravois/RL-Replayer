# RL-Replayer
### a tool to recreate Rocket League match replays in Maya, eventually Unreal, for viewing in VR/AR

I love Rocket League! 
It's car-soccer, a unique and practically perfect video game of intuitive physics and deep skill development. One of its many delightful features is the ability to store finished matches as replays, for review, sharing video clips, etc. I prefer to use the Free Camera, hovering over the whole field, so I can see the gameplay as a whole, and visualize how my positioning and rotations contribute or harm my results. 

I also love VR, and AR, and in particular the strong sense of spatiality they create. When the 3D visualization is directly related to or controlled by your bodily movement in the real world, it's a very powerful experience, far more solid than watching animation or playing a game on a screen.

Ever since watching my first Rocket League replay, I've wanted to experience it in VR. Not playing the game in VR--that sounds nauseating to me. But watching the replay unfold as if tiny cars were driving around on my desktop. So that's what I'm trying to do here: to translate the replay file into a 3D animation file, and implement that animation within Unreal Engine or three.js, or other framework that lets it be experienced as VR. First step: recreate the basics of the replay animation in Autodesk Maya. 

## Caveats: 

### +++ This project may get abandoned at any moment! +++ 
This is an unpaid hobby project for lolz, and I am easily distracted!

I do not work for Psyonix or Epic Games, or know anyone who does. This is an unofficial fan-made tool.

No promise of working functionality, new features, bug fixes, or anything. Blah blah blah, you know the deal.
